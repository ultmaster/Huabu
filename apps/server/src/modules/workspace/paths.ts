/**
 * Workspace paths that outlive the storage backend.
 *
 * What remains here passes the §12.5.2 test: it is still meaningful once the
 * structured backend keeps Spaces in tables. Two populations qualify.
 *
 *   - Workspace-level, no canvasId: `setting/` and the user memory file.
 *     Untouched by a backend switch.
 *   - Per-Space state owned by *another* domain — ACP sessions, now the only
 *     one — which needs a materialized directory but not the Disk record
 *     layout. It anchors on the Space's Disk tree from the storage facade, so
 *     it no longer consults the Disk name index (§12.5.4).
 *
 * Three families have already left. Memory-worker bookkeeping and the debug
 * prompt log build their own stores on the storage extension substrate
 * (§6.4.4), which is a place rather than a path; the Space memory body is a
 * blob under the Space's own scope (§6.4.3, disposition D), so neither its
 * placement nor its name is named here any more. ACP sessions leave with
 * phase 6.
 *
 * The Disk record and blob layout moved to `storage/backends/disk/layout.ts`.
 *
 * Layout under `<workspace>/`:
 *
 *   setting/                        user-owned, cross-Space
 *     user.md                       user memory (preferences)
 *     skills/<id>/SKILL.md          user / memory-agent authored skills
 *   <spaceDir>/
 *     .history/
 *       acp-sessions.json           per-thread ACP sessionId map (optional)
 *
 * Naming convention: anything prefixed with `.` is hidden / AI-private;
 * anything without the prefix is user-visible.
