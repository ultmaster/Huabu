/**
 * Centralised workspace path management.
 *
 * Two operating modes, decided at process startup by the presence of the
 * `HUABU_WORKSPACE` environment variable:
 *
 *   ── Free mode (default for local dev) ──
 *     `HUABU_WORKSPACE` is *unset*.
 *     The user picks any absolute directory at runtime via the client
 *     (folder picker / path input). `setWorkspacePath(absPath)` is the
 *     entry point. The active path can change during the process lifetime.
 *
 *   ── Managed mode (recommended for remote / single-tenant deployments) ──
 *     `HUABU_WORKSPACE=/abs/path` is set at process start.
 *     The path is locked at boot via {@link initWorkspaceFromEnv} and
 *     CANNOT be changed at runtime. The client gets a read-only label
 *     (the basename of the path) and no folder-picker UI. To run a
 *     different workspace, restart the process with a different env
 *     value — typically one process per user / per workspace, with the
 *     network access controlled by your reverse proxy.
 *
 * Either way, every storage layer resolves its directory relative to a
 * single workspace root.
 *
 * Directory layout inside the active workspace (canvas-centric):
 *
 *   <workspace>/
 *     .workspace.json
 *     <canvasId>/
 *       space.json
 *       nodes/<nodeId>.md
 *       artifacts/<file>
 *       memory/preferences.md
 *       .history/{chat/<threadId>.json,events.jsonl}
