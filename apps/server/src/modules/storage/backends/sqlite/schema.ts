/**
 * The SQLite schema, and the rule for changing it.
 *
 * One file per version, applied in order, never edited once released. The
 * migration runner in `database.ts` enforces that shape; this file is only the
 * SQL. Everything is `STRICT` so a column's declared type is a real
 * constraint, and every child row reaches its owner through a foreign key so
 * deleting a Space or a Workspace cannot leave the rest behind.
 *
 * Two collections sit at the top: Workspaces, which are the namespaces a
 * deployment holds, and Spaces, which belong to exactly one of them. That is
 * the whole reason a SQL profile needs no Workspace directory — a Workspace is
 * a row, not a folder, and switching to another one re-scopes queries through
 * the same connection rather than reopening anything (proposal §2, "Backend
 * selection scope").
 *
 * Blobs deliberately do **not** reference `spaces`. The two ports are
 * configured independently and their lifecycles are joined only by the
 * deletion saga in `storage.ts`, which sweeps every blob area *before* the
 * structured record goes. A foreign key here would quietly move that ordering
 * decision into the schema, and would refuse the orphan sweep the saga
 * performs when a record has already gone missing.
 */

/**
 * Version 1 — Workspaces, Spaces, and everything a Space owns.
 *
 * `collision_key` is the de-duplicated, case-folded name a Space or node is
 * filed under. It exists because titles and labels collide and the product
 * resolves that with " (2)" suffixes; the UNIQUE constraints are what make
 * the allocation in `identity.ts` authoritative rather than advisory.
