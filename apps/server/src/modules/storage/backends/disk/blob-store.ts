/**
 * Disk implementation of the blob port.
 *
 * Maps each area of a Space to a directory under that Space's root, preserving
 * the layout the workspace format has always used: one file per blob, named by
 * the URL key, no manifest indirection.
 *
 * Where the Space's root *is* depends on the structured backend, which is why
 * it is injected rather than resolved here. When Disk also keeps the records,
 * the areas sit inside the Space folder the user can see — unchanged from
 * every Workspace that already exists. When the records live in a database
 * there is no such folder, so composition hands over a server-owned directory
 * instead; the layout beneath it is identical either way.
 *
 * Each scope is bound to the workspace active when it is created. A fresh
 * scope follows a workspace switch; a retained scope rejects the next
 * operation instead of silently redirecting it into the new workspace.
