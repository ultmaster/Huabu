/**
 * Which product features a storage profile can actually serve.
 *
 * Some features are *about* a filesystem — showing a folder in Finder,
 * adopting a document a user dropped in from outside, a bundle that is a
 * directory zipped up. A backend that keeps Spaces in tables has no honest
 * answer for them, and the honest outcome is that the feature is
 * **unavailable, not emulated** (proposal §6.4.2, disposition A). A
 * workaround that makes such a feature *nearly* work is worse than its
 * absence: it has to be built, tested, and explained, and it hides the
 * limitation instead of stating it.
 *
 * "Stated" is what this file is for. An outcome of A is an acceptable product
 * limitation only if an operator can learn it when they select a profile
 * rather than when a user clicks the button — so the matrix sits beside
 * profile validation, which is the one place a profile is inspected before
 * anything opens.
 *
 * This is a *declaration*, not an enforcement point. Each listed feature also
 * refuses at its own call site, because a matrix nobody consults at runtime is
 * documentation. What the matrix adds is the up-front answer.
 *
 * Two rules keep those call sites honest:
 *
 *   - **A refusal asks the matrix.** `storageServes(id)` on the composition
 *     root, never a re-derivation of the requirement such as "is there a
 *     `diskTree`". A gate that re-derives is a second copy of the rule, and it
 *     is how a row could grow a blob-axis requirement its own call site never
 *     learned about.
 *   - **A degradation does not.** Code that renders absence rather than
 *     refusing — the memory preamble reading as empty — asks the concrete
 *     predicate, because it is not making the profile's promise, only reading
 *     what is there.
 *
 * Every row must therefore be refusable. A property that nothing can ask about
 * is not a capability: it is a fact about a backend, and it belongs in that
 * backend's own commentary. Windows directory-handle coordination was listed
 * here and removed for exactly that reason — a Space with no directory
 * registers no handle owner, so nothing ever asks and nothing is lost.

/**
 * A product feature some storage profiles cannot serve.

 * Keyed on the **profile**, not on one axis. Most entries need a Space or a
 * Workspace to be a real directory, which is a structured-backend property —
 * but several need more than that: they need the Space's *bytes* to be in that
 * directory too, and that is the blob backend's business. A matrix that asked
 * only the structured axis would call a bundle exportable on a profile that
 * archives a Space folder its artifacts had never been written to.
 *
 * Each row therefore states a {@link StorageRequirement} rather than a list of
 * backends: every axis it names must hold, and an axis it does not name is one
 * it does not depend on.

 * configured backend has to be one of them.
 *
 * So `{ structured: ['disk'], blobs: ['disk'] }` reads "the structured backend
 * must be Disk *and* the blob backend must be Disk", and a future
 * `{ structured: ['disk', 'postgres'] }` would read "the structured backend
 * must be Disk *or* Postgres, and the blob backend may be anything".
 *
 * **An absent clause is not a requirement**, so every backend on that axis
 * passes. That default is the design rather than a shortcut: a feature that
 * does not touch a Space's bytes must not need editing when a blob backend is
 * added, and the features that do are exactly the ones that should be forced
 * to decide then. A requirement with no clauses at all requires nothing, which
 * is not a limitation — `capabilities.test.ts` rejects one.
