/**
 * Structured storage port — domain records, not opaque bytes.
 *
 * The connection ({@link StructuredStore}) owns backend identity and
 * lifecycle, and vends a {@link SpaceHandle} per Space. The handle is a
 * composite of narrow, asynchronous repositories: the versioned Space record
 * ({@link SpaceRepository}), four Canvas-owned log-family repositories, and
 * the canonical Task/Run repository.
 *
 * Scope note: node sidecars are still reached through
 * {@link LegacyNodeStore}, a deliberately narrow *synchronous* transitional
 * surface. Node persistence is the one part of the Space a non-Disk adapter
 * cannot yet implement, because the write coordinator's atomicity argument
 * depends on `readNode` / `writeNode` being synchronous. Replacing it is a
 * later phase; see docs/proposals/multi-backend-storage.md §12.2.7.
 *
 * Guarantee scope: the concurrency properties below (single-winner CAS,
 * linearizable appends) are **adapter-local**. They hold for calls made
 * through these repositories. The compatibility facade remains a second
 * mutation entry point until its writers migrate, so a passing contract suite
 * is not evidence that the running application has one write authority. See
 * §12.2.3.
 *
 * This file may not import a backend implementation or the compatibility
 * layer. Persistence DTOs come from the Canvas domain.
