 * Blob storage port — opaque bytes, not application records.
 *
 * The connection ({@link BlobStore}) is the primary object; it vends one
 * {@link SpaceBlobs} handle per Space, mirroring how `StructuredStore` vends
 * one {@link SpaceHandle} per Space. Both ports are reached the same way for
 * the same reason: a Space is the unit the application addresses, and a port
 * that made the caller assemble a descriptor first would be the odd one out.
 *
 * Artifact identity, ownership, MIME representation, and lifecycle are
 * application concerns; this port only moves bytes. Today the HTTP boundary
 * infers MIME from the blob name, matching the previous `sendFile()` behavior.
 * Nothing here exposes a permanent local path — see {@link BlobLease} for the
 * one bounded exception.
 *
 * See docs/proposals/multi-backend-storage.md §6.2.

 *
 * Two rules make the lease mean the same thing on every backend, because
 * this is where adapters would otherwise diverge invisibly:
 *
 * 1. **The path is read-only.** Writing through it corrupts authoritative
 *    bytes on Disk and silently mutates a doomed temp copy on a remote
 *    backend. Neither is a supported operation.
 * 2. **The path is invalid once {@link release} resolves.** Disk physically
 *    keeps its file — the path *is* its storage — so reading a retained copy
 *    of the string would keep working there and fail on a remote backend.
 *    Accessing {@link path} after release therefore throws on every backend,
 *    so the stronger Disk behavior can't be depended on by accident.
 *
 * Use with `try`/`finally` — the repo targets ES2020, so `await using` is
 * not available. Build leases with {@link createBlobLease} rather than an
 * object literal, so both rules hold without each adapter restating them.
