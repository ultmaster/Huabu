 * Storage composition root.
 *
 * Builds one {@link BlobStore} and one {@link StructuredStore} from a

 * the only place that maps a backend kind to an adapter.
 *
 * The module-level holder is process-wide, while `workspace.ts` selects the
 * active namespace used through it. Workspace activation never reconstructs
 * these backend connections: a SQL adapter serves every Workspace through one
 * live connection or pool and scopes repository/handle operations by id. Call
 * {@link initStorage} from the server entry point so a bad profile fails at
 * startup with an actionable message.
 *
 * Anything that reaches for storage without that — tests, scripts — builds
 * the adapters on demand. That path is synchronous, so it cannot `await
 * init()`, and it is therefore only legal for backends that have nothing to
 * open; see {@link requiresExplicitInit}. It is not a lazy version of
 * {@link initStorage}, and a connection-holding backend must not be reached
 * through it.
