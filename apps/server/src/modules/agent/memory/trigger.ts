/**
 * Memory worker trigger state.
 *
 * Per-canvas bookkeeping for the memory sub-agent (`worker.ts`):
 *
 *   counter             how many user-driven canvas ops we've seen
 *                       since the last analysis pass; the worker is
 *                       enqueued when this crosses {@link OP_THRESHOLD}.
 *   lastAnalyzedAt      epoch ms of the last successful analysis;
 *                       null until the first pass lands.
 *   lastSeenThreadCursor retained compatibility field from the removed
 *                       legacy chat digest. Existing state files preserve it,
 *                       but current analysis passes do not advance it.
 *
 * Persisted on the storage extension substrate under the `huabu.memory`
 * namespace, so the counter survives process restarts. Storage hands this
 * module a place and nothing else — it never sees these three fields, and this
 * module owns the format, one small store per backend kind (proposal §6.4.4).
 * The state is kept tiny (<128 B) and atomic-written; read / write failures are
 * reported but never thrown — losing it at worst means we miss or duplicate
 * one analysis pass, which is harmless.
